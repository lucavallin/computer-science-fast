# Computer Science (fast)

Inspired by [ossu/computer-science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) and [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/).
The list is intended as a refresher for professionals or as a primer for newcomers, covering most computer science fundamentals and hot topics in the industry with short, easy, practical, condensed books to read quickly and in a self-paced fashion while providing a good overview of each area.

Please notice, these books aren't necessarily free, thorough or the best choice for the topics and require you to already have an understanding of programming.

# What's next?
I would advise you to have a look at the resources linked above which this document takes inspiration from. They contain books and resources that go much deeper into detail. For further reading and to build upon the fundamentals, have a look at [mustread.tech/books](https://mustread.tech/books).

As a suggestion, I would pick up more books on the topics of operating systems internals, compilers, design patterns and modern development practices.

# Contributing
Do you know books that are shorter and offer the same content, or slightly longer but more comprehensive? Please open a new issue with your suggestions.
